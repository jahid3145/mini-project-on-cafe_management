## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.x** installed on your system

### Steps to Run
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open terminal / command prompt
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Run the program using:

```bash
python Contract_Book_App.py
📋 How the Application Works

The application displays a menu with multiple options.

User selects an option by entering a number (1–7).

Contacts are stored in memory using a Python dictionary.

The program runs continuously until the user chooses Exit.

1. Add Contact
2. View Contact
3. Update Contact
4. Delete Contact
5. Search Contacts

    "phone": "9876543210",
    "email": "john@gmail.com"
  }
}

⚠️ Limitations

Data is not persistent (contacts are lost when the program exits)

No file or database storage

Console-based (no GUI)

🔮 Future Improvements

Add file handling (save contacts to a file)

Implement database support

Add GUI using Tkinter

Add input validation

Support multiple phone numbers
